# image-bug-detection
This project focuses on detecting the presence of a specific bug image within a larger image using image processing techniques and statistical analysis

**Project Overview:** This Python script is designed to detect the presence of a specific pattern (bug) in an image and locate its position to serves as an example of image analysis.  It involves breaking down the larger image into smaller patches, calculating rolling means, and computing correlations to identify the most likely location of the bug. The project provides insights into locating the bug image within the larger image and displays the identified patch as well as its coordinates.

**To Run:**
1. Place the target image containing the bug as 'bug.png' in the project directory.
2. Place the image in which you want to detect the bug as 'Chickens_with_bug.png' in the project directory.
3. Run the provided Python script.
